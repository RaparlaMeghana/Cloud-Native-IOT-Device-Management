> 🚀 **“From edge to insight – your smart gateway to IoT device control.”**

A futuristic, cloud-native IoT platform that **simulates real-world sensors**, **streams data in real-time**, and visualizes it on a modern, responsive dashboard. Built using **Flask**, **HTML5**, and **Python**, this project lays the foundation for scalable **device-to-cloud integration**.

---

## 🧠 What Makes This Unique?

✅ **Real-Time Simulation Engine**  
✅ **Interactive Frontend Dashboard**  
✅ **Stateless Flask APIs**  
✅ **Lightweight & Cloud Ready**  
✅ **Built for Scale, Designed for Simplicity**

---

## ⚙️ System Architecture

- **Simulator**: Generates sensor data (temperature, humidity, gas levels)
- **Backend**: REST API accepts & returns real-time data
- **Frontend**: Beautiful dashboard displaying latest values

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Flask** – Web server and routing  
- **MQTT** – Lightweight protocol for IoT messaging  
- **JavaScript & Chart.js** – For real-time charts  
- **Bootstrap 5** – UI styling  
- **REST APIs** – External weather/air quality API integrations  
- **Matplotlib + Pandas** – Backend analytics & reports

---

## ⚡ Live Data Simulation

- Simulated sensors (randomized or scripted values)  
- Weather/air-quality APIs as virtual sensors  
- MQTT test broker for mock publishing/subscribing
